git push origin main
(If the branch is master, use git push origin master instead)

Enter your GitHub username and password (if prompted).
(For 2FA users, generate a personal access token from GitHub and use it as the password.)

Step 7: Pull from GitHub (Update Local Copy)
If changes were made on GitHub, fetch them:

sh
Copy
Edit
git pull origin main
(Use master if the branch is master.)

Step 8: Create and Switch Branches
Create a new branch:

sh
Copy
Edit
git branch feature-branch
Switch to the new branch:

sh
Copy
Edit
git checkout feature-branch
Push the branch to GitHub:

sh
Copy
Edit
git push origin feature-branch
Step 9: Merge Branches
Switch to main branch:

sh
Copy
Edit
git checkout main
Merge the feature-branch:

sh
Copy
Edit
git merge feature-branch
Push the merged changes:

sh
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
Step 10: Delete a Branch
Delete the branch locally:

sh
Copy
Edit
git branch -d feature-branch
Delete the branch from GitHub:

sh
Copy
Edit
git push origin --delete feature-branch

You can create a new GitHub repository via the command line (cmd) using GitHub's CLI tool (gh). Hereâ€™s how:

Step 1: Install GitHub CLI
Download and install GitHub CLI from:
ðŸ‘‰ GitHub CLI Download

Verify installation:

sh
Copy
Edit
gh --version
Step 2: Authenticate GitHub CLI
Log in to GitHub:

sh
Copy
Edit
gh auth login
Choose GitHub.com.

Select HTTPS or SSH authentication.

If using HTTPS, authenticate with a GitHub token (generate at GitHub Tokens).

Step 3: Create a New Repository
Navigate to the folder where you want to create the project:

sh
Copy
Edit
cd C:\Projects
Create a new repository:

sh
Copy
Edit
gh repo create my-repo --public --source=. --remote=origin
Options:

--public â†’ Creates a public repo.

--private â†’ Creates a private repo.

--source=. â†’ Uses the current directory.

--remote=origin â†’ Sets up a remote link.

If you donâ€™t have a local project yet, initialize it:

sh
Copy
Edit
mkdir my-repo
cd my-repo
git init
Step 4: Add and Push Files
Add a new file:

sh
Copy
Edit
echo "My first GitHub repo" > README.md
Track the file:

sh
Copy
Edit
git add README.md
Commit the file:

sh
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Push to GitHub:

sh
Copy
Edit
git push -u origin main
Step 5: Verify Repository
Check if the repository was created successfully:

sh
Copy
Edit
gh repo view my-repo
Now, your new GitHub repository is live, and you can start pushing code! ðŸš€

To create a new folder in your GitHub repository using the command line (cmd), follow these steps:

Step 1: Navigate to Your Repository
sh
Copy
Edit
cd C:\Projects\my-repo
Step 2: Create a New Folder
Use the mkdir command to create a folder.

sh
Copy
Edit
mkdir new-folder
Navigate inside the folder (optional):

Step 4: Add, Commit, and Push
Add the folder and its contents:

clone my-repo
ChatGPT said:
To clone your repository (my-repo) to your local machine using the command line (cmd), follow these steps:

Step 1: Get the Repository URL
Go to your GitHub repository page (e.g., https://github.com/your-username/my-repo).

Click on the green "Code" button and copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., https://github.com/your-username/my-repo.git).

Step 2: Clone the Repository
Open cmd on your local machine.

Navigate to the directory where you want to store the repo:

sh
Copy
Edit
cd C:\Projects
Clone the repository using the git clone command:

sh
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-repo.git
Replace https://github.com/your-username/my-repo.git with the URL you copied.

Step 3: Navigate into the Cloned Repository
After cloning, navigate into the repository directory:

sh
Copy
Edit
cd my-repo
Now you have successfully cloned the repository! You can start working on it locally. ðŸš€

To create a folder in your local repository and push it to GitHub using the command line (cmd), follow these steps:

Step 1: Navigate to Your Local Repository
Open cmd and navigate to your local repository directory:

sh
Copy
Edit
cd C:\Projects\my-repo
Step 2: Create a New Folder
Create a new folder in your local repository:

sh
Copy
Edit
mkdir new-folder
Navigate into the folder (optional):

sh
Copy
Edit
cd new-folder
Step 3: Add a File to the Folder (Git Tracks Non-Empty Folders)
Since Git doesn't track empty folders, create a file to add to the folder:

sh

echo "This is a new folder in the repository" > new-folder/README.md
Step 4: Add, Commit, and Push the Folder
Stage the folder and its contents:

sh
Copy
Edit
git add new-folder/*
Commit the changes:

sh
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "Added new-folder with README.md"
Push the changes to GitHub:

sh
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
(If your branch is master, use git push origin master instead.)

Step 5: Verify the Folder on GitHub
Go to your GitHub repository page, and you should see the newly created folder and the file within it.

That's it! You've successfully created a folder in your local repository and pushed it to GitHub. ðŸš€
